# Vision

Aiming at quickly deploying,managing,monitoring and automating the operation and maintenance of Big Data service components and nodes,helping you quickly build stable, efficient Big Data cluster services.

# What is DataSophon?

*The Three-Body Problem*, a Hugo Award-winning work of the world's highest science fiction literature, is known for its stunning "hard science fiction" style, and its author Liu Cixin is credited with "single-handedly raising Chinese science fiction to a world-class level".

As a very important role in the Triad, the Sophon is a two-dimensional unfolding of the nine-dimensional proton, which is transformed into a supercomputer through circuit etching and then transferred back to the microscopic eleventh dimension to monitor every human movement and use quantum entanglement to achieve instantaneous communication to report to the Triad civilization four light years away. To put it bluntly, the Sophon is a AI real-time remote monitoring and management platform deployed by the Triad civilization on Earth.

DataSophon is a similar management platform. Unlike the Sophon, which aims to limit human's basic science and hinder human's technology development, DataSophon is dedicated to automatical monitoring, operation and management of Big Data infrastructure components and nodes, helping you to quickly build a stable, efficient Big Data cluster service.

## Key Features

* Easy to deploy, can quickly complete the deployment of about 300 nodes of big data clusters
* Nationalization compatible, compatible with arm servers and common localized operating systems
* Comprehensive and rich monitoring indicators, showing that the users care about most, based on production practice.
* Flexible and convenient alarm service, which can realize user-defined alarm groups and alarm indicators
* Strong scalability, users can integrate or upgrade any components through configuration.
